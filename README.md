# makit

[![ci](https://github.com/runsnip/makit/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/runsnip/makit/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Security for Linux servers you run yourself — find what is wrong, block what attacks, and set up new servers safely.
One command-line tool (`makit`), MIT-licensed, for Ubuntu and Debian.

| | What makit does |
| --- | --- |
| **Check** — `makit scan` | Read-only security check of the host and every Docker container (with your consent): malware and miner indicators, suspicious processes and connections, persistence, vulnerable npm packages (OSV), and posture — SSH, firewall, Docker ports, updates, kernel, secrets. Every finding links to a guide. |
| **Protect** — `makit shield` | A gate in front of your web traffic: its own IP set (millions of entries, no ipset), allowlist, the real client IP behind any CDN or load balancer, HTTP rules, request scoring (probes, XSS, SQL injection…), bots/crawlers/AI agents verified and handled by your policy, rate limits, automatic bans. Works with Caddy/nginx asking it, or in front of them. |
| **Alert** — `makit notify`, `makit schedule` | Scheduled scans and ban reports to Telegram, Slack, Google Chat, Discord, Teams, ntfy, webhooks or email. |
| **Set up and harden** — `makit init` | A fresh server in one command: upgrades, swap, Docker, firewall (Docker ports included), automatic updates, kernel and SSH hardening, fail2ban, AppArmor, auditd — idempotent, with `--dry-run`. |
| **Watch** — `makit top` | A terminal dashboard: system, processes, containers, services, logs, setup. |

The threat knowledge — rules, scoring sets, the bot catalog, vulnerabilities — is data in [`security/`](security/),
updated with `makit rules update` and overridable per server. What the shield costs per request is measured in
[`benchmark/`](benchmark/), reproducible with one command.

Install (as root):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://makit.sh/install.sh | sh
```

A given version: `curl -fsSL https://makit.sh/install.sh | sh -s -- v0.7.0` (or `https://makit.sh/v0.7.0/install.sh`).
Website and guides: [makit.sh](https://makit.sh).

Set up a new server — preview first, then apply:

```bash
makit init --dry-run
makit init
```

`makit init` runs, in order: system upgrade and base packages → swap → kernel settings → Docker → (optional)
block-storage volume → firewall (with Docker-published ports behind ufw) → automatic security updates → hardening
(kernel, /dev/shm, fail2ban, AppArmor, auditd) → key-only SSH. Every step checks what is
already done, so running it again is harmless. Every command accepts `--dry-run`.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `makit init [options]` | Everything below, in a safe order. `makit init --help` lists the options. |
| `makit system-upgrade [--full] [--autoremove]` | `apt-get update` + `upgrade` (or `dist-upgrade` with `--full`), non-interactive, keeps your config files, warns when a reboot is required. |
| `makit base` | `makit system-upgrade`, then installs curl, git, rsync, ufw, fail2ban, unattended-upgrades, jq… |
| `makit swap [SIZE\|auto]` | Creates `/swapfile` (auto: 2G below 2 GB of RAM, 4G up to 16 GB, none above) and sets `vm.swappiness=10`. Never resizes an existing swap file. |
| `makit sysctl KEY=VALUE… \| opensearch` | Persists kernel settings in `/etc/sysctl.d/90-makit.conf` and applies them. `opensearch` = `vm.max_map_count=262144`. |
| `makit docker` | Docker Engine + Compose plugin from download.docker.com; caps container logs at 3 × 20 MB (only if `/etc/docker/daemon.json` does not exist yet). |
| `makit volume DEVICE\|auto MOUNTPOINT [--docker] [--format]` | Mounts a block-storage volume (DigitalOcean, Hetzner, GCP, AWS EBS) by UUID with `nofail`. `--docker` keeps Docker's named volumes on it and makes Docker wait for the mount. `--format` creates ext4 only on an empty device, after asking. |
| `makit firewall [PORT/PROTO…] [--docker] [--egress PORTS\|off]` | ufw: deny incoming except the given ports (default 22/tcp 80/tcp 443/tcp 443/udp) **plus every port sshd listens on**; existing rules are kept. `--docker` puts Docker-published ports behind ufw; `--egress "443/tcp"` lets containers connect out only to those ports (+ DNS). |
| `makit updates` | Unattended security upgrades (reboots stay manual). |
| `makit harden [--tmp-noexec]` | Kernel hardening sysctls, `/dev/shm` noexec, SSH limits, fail2ban sshd jail, AppArmor, auditd rules for programs run from temporary directories. |
| `makit ssh` | Disables SSH password login, root keeps key login. **Skipped if root has no authorized key.** |
| `makit status` | Read-only summary: RAM, swap, disks, Docker, firewall, SSH, kernel settings, pending reboot. |
| `makit list [--json]` | Each part makit manages and whether it is in place (the Setup tab uses this). |
| `makit top` | Terminal dashboard with mouse support — see below. |
| `makit scan [options]` | Read-only security check of the host and/or containers — see below. |
| `makit rules list\|update\|path` | The security catalog `scan` uses; `update` fetches the newest one from this repository. |
| `makit schedule scan daily\|weekly\|hourly\|off [--webhook=URL]` | Scheduled read-only scans (systemd timer) with a webhook alert when something MEDIUM or worse is found. Consent is asked once. |
| `makit shield on\|off\|ban\|allow\|list\|log\|snippet …` | IP gate for web traffic — its own block set and allowlist, real client IPs behind any CDN or load balancer, HTTP rules with automatic bans, request snapshots. Caddy/nginx ask it, or it sits in front of them — see below. |
| `makit docs [topic\|RULE-ID]` | The [security guides](docs/security/README.md), offline: what each finding means and how to fix it. |
| `makit upgrade [--check] [vX.Y.Z]` | Checks GitHub for a newer makit and installs it after asking (`--check` only reports: exit 10 when an update exists). `self-update` is an alias. |
| `makit version`, `makit -v`, `makit --version` | Prints the installed version. |

Global options: `--dry-run` (change nothing), `--yes` (confirm prompts, e.g. `--format` without a terminal).

Output is coloured at a terminal and plain when it is piped or saved; `NO_COLOR=1` turns colour off, `FORCE_COLOR=1`
keeps it on (CI logs, `less -R`). Reports that are saved or sent as notifications never carry colour codes.

### Example: a Docker host with OpenSearch and a DigitalOcean volume

```bash
makit init --sysctl opensearch --volume auto --mount /mnt/data --docker-volumes --format
```

## makit top

A terminal dashboard, no htop needed. Mouse: click tabs, click column headers to sort, scroll with the wheel, click a
row to select it (click again to open), click buttons. Keyboard: `1`–`8`, arrows, `/` to filter, `q` to quit. The version line on the right is green when makit is up to date and yellow when
a newer release exists (`makit upgrade` installs it; checked at start and every 6 hours).

| Tab | Shows | Actions (asks first, needs root) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Overview | CPU per core + history, memory, swap, network, disks, top processes, health summary | — |
| Processes | All processes: CPU%, memory, threads, state, command | `k` send SIGTERM |
| Containers | Docker containers with CPU and memory | logs, restart, start/stop |
| Services | systemd services (`f` failed only) | journal, restart |
| Disks | Usage per filesystem, read/write per disk | — |
| Logs | System journal (follows the end) | — |
| Shield | The gate: service, **Ask** (Caddy/nginx ask makit) and **Edge** (makit checks and blocks in front) as separate switches, mode, counters; bans, allowlist, bot IPs and bot IP sources | turn on/off, toggle ask/edge/mode, + Ban IP, + Allow IP, + Bot IP, + Bot URL (typed inline), remove, latest reports |
| Setup | Everything `makit init` manages, ✓/✗ per item | Install / re-run with a live log, "install all missing" |

## makit scan

A **read-only** security check: a search for malware dropped on a server or inside containers — for example the Go backdoor dropped
through CVE-2025-55182 (React2Shell) as `/tmp/vim`, started with `nohup` and then deleted
([analysis](https://github.com/ngvcanh/CVE-2025-55182-Attack-Analysis)).

```bash
makit scan                              # the host (all processes, including those in containers)
makit scan --container web             # one container's filesystem, seen from the host — no docker exec
makit scan --all-containers --host      # everything
makit scan --json --consent > report.json   # automation: --consent replaces the interactive confirmation
```

Before anything is read, makit lists what it will look at and asks you to type `yes`. **It never modifies, deletes,
moves, quarantines, executes or uploads anything** — it prints findings with evidence and suggested next steps.

What it looks for (every finding links its [guide](docs/security/README.md); `makit docs <rule>` shows it offline):

- **Processes** running a deleted executable (run-then-`rm`), from `/tmp`, `/dev/shm` or a hidden directory, from memory
  only (memfd), disguised as kernel threads (`[kworker/0:1]`) or named like a system tool they are not.
- **Network** connections to known-bad IPs, to common miner/backdoor ports, or from those suspicious processes.
- **Files** in temporary and home directories: unexpected or hidden executables, SHA256 matches with known malware,
  Go binaries with backdoor traits (HTTP + SOCKS5 + TLS/ChaCha20), downloader scripts (`wget … -O /tmp/…; chmod +x;
  nohup`); in containers, every file added or changed since the image (`docker diff`).
- **Persistence**: cron, systemd units, `rc.local`, `/etc/ld.so.preload`, shell profiles, recently changed SSH keys.
- **Entry points**: installed packages affected by advisories in the catalog (e.g. Next.js / React for CVE-2025-55182).
- **Configuration**: SSH password login, firewall, databases/admin ports reachable from the internet, Docker ports
  bypassing ufw, containers that are privileged / have the Docker socket / run as root / have an executable `/tmp`,
  pending security updates, kernel settings, `/dev/shm`, fail2ban, AppArmor, auditd, log shipping, `.env` permissions.

`makit scan --only malware|posture|vulns` runs a subset.

Everything it knows — indicators, patterns, severities, vulnerabilities (OSV format) — is data in
[`security/`](security/README.md), read from the bundled catalog, the newest one from this repository
(`makit rules update`) and your own (`--rules DIR`). Each finding names its rule (`MK-…`) and references (CVE ids).
Exit status: `0` nothing above LOW, `1` MEDIUM or worse, `2` error, `3` consent not given.

## makit shield

Blocks visitors by IP before they reach your app, with its own set (IPs/CIDRs with expiry — no ipset) and an
allowlist that always wins. Behind a CDN, a load balancer or both it finds the visitor in `X-Forwarded-For`, walking
back through the proxies you trust (`trusted_proxies`); a visitor faking headers is judged on its own IP. HTTP rules from the
catalog ban scanners, secret probing, path traversal and the React2Shell exploitation pattern automatically.

```bash
makit shield on                    # --observe to only log what would be blocked
makit shield snippet caddy         # Caddy/nginx ask makit before every request (forward_auth / auth_request)
makit shield ban 198.51.100.7 --for 24h
makit shield allow 192.0.2.10
makit shield log --blocked
```

Or put makit in front of Caddy/nginx (it terminates TLS and forwards to localhost). Guide:
[docs/security/shield.md](docs/security/shield.md).

Every request is also scored (probes, XSS and SQL injection in the URL, scanners, floods — the scoring set is
[online in this repo](security/scoring/http.yaml) and you can override it per server). Bots, crawlers and AI agents are
recognised and verified (a fake Googlebot is caught), and you choose per category or per bot:

```bash
makit shield bots set ai-crawler block      # no AI training crawlers
makit shield bots set gptbot "limit 30/1m"  # …or let one in slowly
makit shield customize scoring              # your own copy of the scoring set in /etc/makit/security
```

One server, many domains: the top of `shield.yaml` is the global policy and `sites:` overrides it per domain (mode,
bans for the site only or the whole server, bot policy, scoring profiles, rules, report channels).

Guide: [docs/security/bots.md](docs/security/bots.md).

Check a config before it is loaded — every key, value, listener and catalog setting, with the line and the fix — and
see what it would change on your real traffic (`--replay` runs an access log through the current and the new config;
nothing is written). `makit shield edit` saves only a file that passes. Or build one in the browser:
[makit.sh/playground.html](https://makit.sh/playground.html), checked by the same code compiled to WebAssembly.

### Behind a load balancer, and in Kubernetes

Behind AWS ALB or any proxy, the visitor is read from the right of `X-Forwarded-For` (trusted proxies skipped), so
nobody picks their own IP; an NLB's PROXY protocol works too. In a cluster, makit-shield runs as a small Deployment
(signed image, Helm chart) that Envoy Gateway, Istio, Traefik or ingress-nginx ask before every request, and its
replicas share bans, rate limits and scores: banned on one pod means banned on all within milliseconds, and
`limit 60/1m` stays 60 for the cluster — while every decision is still made from local memory. Bans can be pushed to
AWS WAF so the load balancer drops that traffic first, `/metrics` feeds Prometheus, and ALB access logs can be
analysed with the same policy. Guide: [docs/security/kubernetes.md](docs/security/kubernetes.md).

```bash
helm install shield oci://ghcr.io/runsnip/charts/makit-shield -n makit --create-namespace
makit shield snippet envoy-gateway --service shield-makit-shield --namespace makit --gateway eg
```

![tests/k8s-e2e.sh: bans, live config and a shared rate limit across 3 replicas on kind](docs/img/k8s-e2e.png)

What it costs, measured — the full method and more numbers in [benchmark/](benchmark/):

![go test -bench: a decision in about 6 µs, the same with and without a cluster; a ban reaches the other replicas in about 2 ms](docs/img/bench-micro.png)

End to end on a Linux runner, Envoy and Caddy asking makit next to the same paths without it (4 shared vCPUs carry the
load generator, the proxies and makit at once, so part of the added latency is waiting for a CPU — the report says
how to measure makit alone):

![benchmark/run.sh http: makit in front, Caddy and Envoy asking makit, normal and attack traffic, no errors](docs/img/bench-http.png)

## makit notify

Alerts for bans and scan findings on Telegram, Slack, Google Chat, Discord, Microsoft Teams, ntfy, webhooks or email:

```bash
makit notify add telegram --name ops --token BOT_TOKEN --chat-id CHAT_ID
makit notify test
```

Guide: [docs/security/notifications.md](docs/security/notifications.md).

## Safety

- **No lock-out.** `makit ssh` only disables passwords when root has a key in `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`, validates
  the config with `sshd -t` before reloading (and reverts if invalid), then checks the effective setting with `sshd -T`.
  Its drop-in is `sshd_config.d/00-makit.conf`: sshd keeps the first value it reads, so a `99-…` file would lose to
  cloud-init's `50-cloud-init.conf`. The firewall always allows the port sshd actually listens on.
- **No data loss.** Volumes are formatted only with `--format`, only when they have no filesystem, and only after a
  confirmation. Existing swap files and `daemon.json` are left untouched.
- **Docker and ufw.** Ports published by Docker bypass ufw. Bind internal services to `127.0.0.1` in compose
  (`"127.0.0.1:5432:5432"`); publish only what must be public.

## Verify before running

`makit.sh/install.sh` only picks the version and runs that release's own `install.sh` from GitHub, which checks the
source and the `makit-core` binary against the release's `SHA256SUMS` before installing. To read everything first,
take the release's installer straight from GitHub (pinned to a tag, never `main`):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runsnip/makit/v0.7.0/install.sh -o install.sh
less install.sh
bash install.sh
```

The installer puts each version in `/opt/makit/<version>`, points `/opt/makit/current` at it and links
`/usr/local/bin/makit`.

## Requirements

Ubuntu 20.04+ or Debian 11+ (or derivatives), amd64 or arm64, run as root.

## License

MIT — free for any use.

## Development

```bash
tests/smoke.sh          # makit in throwaway ubuntu:24.04 and debian:12 containers
tests/scan-e2e.sh       # replays a React2Shell-style compromise in Docker and checks every finding of makit scan
scripts/build.sh        # gofmt + vet + tests, then makit-core for linux/amd64 and arm64 into dist/
scripts/release.sh X.Y.Z    # bump, tag, push, build and publish the GitHub release
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/mnt" -w /mnt koalaman/shellcheck:stable -x -s bash bin/makit lib/common.sh lib/cmd/*.sh install.sh
```

CI (GitHub Actions) runs all of the above on every push, plus `makit init` for real — twice — on Ubuntu 22.04 and
24.04 VMs, then checks with `makit list` that every part is in place.

Shell commands are one file each in `lib/cmd/` defining `cmd_<name>`; `bin/makit` dispatches to them. `makit top` and
`makit scan` live in `core/` (Go, no cgo): `core/sys` reads `/proc` and the Docker socket, `core/top` is the dashboard,
`core/scan` the scanner.

## Roadmap

v0.6 brought the shield to clusters behind cloud load balancers, and v0.7 made it read whatever stands in front. Next
is v0.8: bans pushed to more edges (Cloudflare Lists, Google Cloud Armor), more load balancer logs, and `makit scan`
for pods and images. Everything
planned, and what is not, is in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) (also at https://makit.sh/docs.html?p=roadmap).
